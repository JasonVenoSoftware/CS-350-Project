# CS-350-Project

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
These two projects utilize code to make LED lights on a powerboard blink at certain intervals.  While it didn't solve a specific problem, it made me significantly more comfortable working with hardware like this.  

# What did you do particularly well?
I kept the code clean and simple.  This is something I learned in various SDLC classes, and was able to carry it over to this style of programming as well.  

# Where could you improve?
Integrating with the libraries and tools that come with the launchboard more would've created a more simplistic and complete project.  

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The most transferable knowledge from this projects are how software and hardware are integrated.  This opens up lots of choices for me, from sensors to the IoT to robotics and more.
